Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

# Description
Credit card fraud is a significant issue in the financial industry, leading to billions of dollars in losses each year. This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing patterns and anomalies in transaction data, the model can identify potentially fraudulent activity in real-time or near real-time.Handling this imbalance and ensuring model accuracy is a major focus of this project.

# Key Features:

Data preprocessing and cleaning
Handling class imbalance 
Model training using algorithms like:
Logistic Regression
Evaluation using metrics suited for imbalanced datasets:
Precision

# Dataset Information
